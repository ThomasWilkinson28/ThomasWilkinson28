## Skills
⚡Electronics design (including soldering, breadboarding, and circuit analysis)

📐3D CAD design (Fusion 360 and SolidWorks)

💻Computer Programming (Python, MATLAB, C)

⚙️Sensors, Actuators, and Automation 

## Experience
#### I enjoy applying and fortifying the knowledge I learn through various projects. Each project listed bellow has helped me refine one or more of my skills:


- #### Semi-Autonomous Gripper robot.
    - ⚡(Connecting electrical components to a Rasberry Pico using a breadboard)
    - 📐(Fusion 360),
    - 💻(Python and C)

  
- #### Dual Square-Wave and Triangular-Wave Oscillator acompanied by a 5-Step Sequencer to make it play a sequence of notes.
    - ⚡(Prototyped circuits using a breadboard and anaylsed them with Oscilloscope and Multimeter)
 
- #### Guitar Pedals.
    - ⚡(Prototyped circuits using a breadboard, analysed them with Oscilloscope and Multimeter, soldered them to a prototype PCB board, and assembled final electronics into drilled enclosures)
      
  
- #### PLC-Operated production line using the Siemens TIA Portal STEP 7 software for which I specifically worked on the sorting part of the assembly line.
    - ⚙️(Applied my LAD and FBD programming knowledge as-well as my understanding of sensors and actuators)


- #### Dino Alarm Clock.
    - 📐(SolidWorks)
